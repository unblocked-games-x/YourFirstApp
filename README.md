### 1. What is YourFirstApp?
YourFirstApp is a community-driven product launch platform designed to help indie makers, developers, and startups showcase their products, gain visibility, collect feedback, and grow their audience. It prioritizes fair exposure and community interaction, distinguishing itself from algorithm-driven platforms that often overlook smaller creators.

### 2. Who can launch on YourFirstApp?
The platform is open exclusively to indie makers, developers, and startups. Whether you’re a solo creator with a side project, a small team launching a SaaS tool, or a startup debuting an MVP, you’re eligible to submit your product.

### 3. Is it free to launch my product?
Yes, launching on YourFirstApp is free to start. The platform offers a free tier that includes product submission, access to community feedback, basic analytics, and the permanent dofollow backlink. Optional paid plans or credit-based features may be available for advanced needs (such as additional analytics or promoted placement), but the core launch functionality is completely free.

### 4. How do I submit my product?
After signing up for a free account, navigate to the “Submit Product” page and fill out the required fields: product name, description, screenshots/demos, relevant tags (to categorize your product, e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Design Tools, SaaS), and your preferred launch date. Review your submission to ensure all information is accurate, then confirm—your launch will go live on the date you selected.

### 5. How does the daily ranking work?
Rankings are primarily determined by community upvotes. Each day, the products with the most upvotes climb the daily leaderboard, with the top performers earning badges and featured placement. Engagement (such as comments and shares) also plays a role, as it indicates higher levels of community interest. External traffic driven to your product page can indirectly boost your ranking by increasing the number of potential upvotes.

### 6. What badges can I earn?
Top-performing launches are awarded Gold, Silver, or Bronze badges based on their daily ranking. These badges are digital credentials that you can embed on your website, landing page, or social media profiles. They serve as social proof, demonstrating that your product has been recognized by a community of creators and early adopters, which can help build trust with potential users.

### 7. Do I get a backlink to my website?
Yes—every product submission includes a permanent dofollow backlink to your website. This backlink is a valuable SEO asset because dofollow links signal to search engines that your site is reputable, which can improve your domain authority and help you rank higher in search results for relevant keywords.

### 8. Can I schedule my launch for a specific date?
Absolutely. During the submission process, you can select a specific launch date that aligns with your marketing strategy. This allows you to plan your launch around key milestones—such as product updates, industry events, or holiday seasons—or target times when your audience is most active. Scheduling also gives you time to promote your launch in advance, building anticipation among your existing network.

### 9. How can I increase my chances of ranking higher?
To improve your ranking, consider the following strategies:
- Craft a clear, compelling product description that highlights your unique value proposition and target audience.
- Use high-quality screenshots or short demos to showcase your product’s functionality—visuals are key to capturing attention.
- Promote your launch to your existing network (social media, email lists, maker communities) to drive initial upvotes and engagement.
- Engage with comments on your product page—responding to questions and feedback shows you’re invested in your product and encourages more interaction.
- Choose relevant tags to ensure your product appears in category searches, making it easier for interested users to find.

### 10. What happens after my launch day?
Your product remains on the platform permanently, continuing to be visible to community members browsing past launches. The permanent backlink remains active, and you can still access analytics to track engagement. Many creators find that their product continues to attract upvotes and users long after the initial launch, as it’s discovered by new members of the community.
